# Marie Curie Coding Language

Marie Curie is a programming language designed to provide a basic yet powerful coding experience. Named after the renowned physicist and
chemist Marie Curie, this language aims to bring a touch of curiosity and exploration to the world of programming.

## Syntax and Features

Marie Curie provides a set of basic mathematical operations and a unique structure defined by specific symbols. The language supports the following features:

### Mathematical Operations

- Addition: `x + y`
- Subtraction: `x - y`
- Multiplication: `x * y`
- Division: `x / y`
- Exponentiation: `x ^ y`
- Parenthesized Expression: `x(y + x)`

### Structure and Symbols

- `p`: Print function to output data to the console.
- `s`: String function to convert ASCII codes to characters.
- `i`: Integer function to convert a value to an integer.
- `fd`: Float function to convert a value to a float.
- `b`: Boolean function to evaluate a value as True (1) or False (0).
- `v`: Variable to store and manipulate values.
- `?`: Conditional statement to perform actions based on a condition.
- `!?`: Else statement to perform actions if the condition is not met.
- `!`: Not operator to negate a boolean value.
- `&&`: Logical AND operator.
- `||`: Logical OR operator.

## Example Code

Here's an example code snippet written in Marrie Curie:

\`\`\`marie
p(s([72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 32, 87, 111, 114, 108, 100]))  # Prints "Hello World"
v.boi = b(1)  # Assigns the boolean value True to the variable boi
?(v.boi){
    p(s([84, 114, 117, 101]))  # Prints "True"
}{
    p(s([70, 97, 108, 115, 101]))  # Prints "False"
}
\`\`\`

In this example, the code prints "Hello World" to the console using the \`p\` function and the \`s\` function to convert ASCII codes to
characters. It also demonstrates the usage of variables, conditional statements, and boolean operations.
